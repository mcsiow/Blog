The result might not be representative if only a small number of people were interviewed.\r\nTo include the number of people interviewed from each country.\r\n2.\r\nThe chart was derived from the survey question “If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it:”. This question does not imply that the individuals are pro-vaccine. There are other similar questions (e.g: “If I do not get a COVID19 vaccine when it is available, I will regret it”) but the results were not used. The result might not be representative and will be misleading to the reader.\r\nTo change the title of the graph or include the question to provide clarity.\r\n3.\r\nThe “Legend” was titled as “Vac1”. Unclear what “Vac1” means. Number 2 to 4 are not labelled to tell reader what it represent.\r\nTo be clear on the information presented.\r\n4.\r\nIs hard to determine the value for each of the response (color bar).\r\nTo label the value for each color bar or re-position the bar.\r\nAesthetics\r\nS/N\r\nCRITIQUES\r\nSUGGESTIONS\r\n1.\r\nAll axes are clearly labeled.\r\nTo continue to label all axes.\r\n2.\r\nGood font and good font size to detailed out the information.\r\nTo maintain the use of good font and good font size.\r\n3.\r\nThe choice of color for the bar is distracting and overwhelming.\r\nTo change the color scheme.\r\n4.\r\nThe left chart was sorted based on country while the right chart was sorted based on percentage of “strongly agreed”. Is hard for reader to match the result for the two charts. Moreover, the information presented in the right chart could be found in the left as well. Is redundant to show the information again (Waste of space).\r\nDo not repeat information presented.\r\n5.\r\nThe gridline for the left chart is too soft / light. Making it hard for reader to use it to reference the values.\r\nTo darken the gridline.\r\nProposed Design\r\nDesign SketchThe Advantages or issues that the alternative design tries to overcome are:\r\nChange the scale of the result from 5 (Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree and Strongly Disagree) to 3 (Agree/Strongly Agree, Neutral and Disagree/Strongly Disagree). Presenting the results in a simplified categories helps in making the chart easier to read. Since Strongly Agree and Agree as well as Strongly Disagree and Disagree, in this instance, do indicate inclination towards willingness or unwillingness.\r\nBreak the Disagree, Agree and Neutral into 3 charts so that readers can see the distribution clearly. \r\nShow the questions so that readers better understand the context to the response. Include details such as when the surveys were taken, number of people involved so as to provide more clarity to readers.\r\nAllow breakdown by Gender, Age etc so that readers can better appreciate the details. \r\nTo have tooltip to detail out more information for readers who are interested to find out more. \r\nTo include Confidence Interval to indicate the uncertainty of the outcome.\r\nData Visualisation Steps\r\n Preparing the Dataset 1. Comparing the fields of the dataset, one can realises that Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden do not have the field “employment_status”. Instead, the employment status was capture by various fields (employment_status_1, employment_status_2 etc.) 2. To align to the rest of the dataset, need to create the field “employment_status” and change the header to reflect the employment status (“Fulltime Employment”,“Not Working” etc) 3. Use the formula to update the value for “employment_status”. 4. Save the file and repeat it for the rest of the countries (Norway, Denmark and Sweden). 5. For Sweden, there is a need to rename “record” to “RecordNo”, to align to rest of the dataset. \r\nImport data into Tableau  1. Select “Text File” from Connect Panel. 2. Select australia.csv.  3. Remove australia.csv from the panel.  4. Click on “New Union” under the File Panel.  5. Import all the countries into the “New Union” panel and click OK. \r\nCommence Data Preparation 1. Hide all the parameters and retain only the following a) RecordNo b) endtime c) household_children d) household_size e) gender f) age g) employment_status h) vac-1 i) vac2_1 j) vac2_2 k) vac2_3 l) vac2_6 and m) vac3. n) Table Name  2. Convert the Connection to “Extract”  3. As we are only interested in Jan 2021 data, click on “Edit” under FILTER to add a filter.  4. Add a filter for “endtime” and set it to Jan 2021.  5. Edit the range of date to Jan 2021, to use only Jan 2021 data. 6. Select (vac1, vac2_1, vac2_2, vac2_3, vac2_6 and vac3) and pivot the data, for ease of processing subsequently.  7. Rename the “Pivot Field Names” to “Question” and “Pivot Field Values” to “Answer”  8. Change the aliases for Question to reflect the actual questions.  9. As the “Answer” value consist of a mix of character and numeric data, need to remove all the characters information. Click on “Custom Split” at “Answer”  10. Add in the separator “–” to “Answer” 11. Add in separator “-” to Answer-Split1  12. Rename Answer-Split2 to “Answer_Cleaned” and change data type to “Number(Whole)”  13. Change the data type for household_size to String.  14. Change the aliases of “Table Name” to remove the .csv portion. \r\nSave the data  1. Click on “Sheet 1” and save the data as “dataviz2.hyer” \r\nPrepare Fields for Visualisation  1. To count the number of record for subsequent formula, Create Calculated Field “RecordNumber” 2. To set record with Negative value to 1 by creating a Calculated Field “Negative Score”. 3. To set record with Positive value to 1 by creating a Calculated Field “Positive Score”. 4. To set record with Neutral value to 1 by creating a Create Calculated Field “Neutral Score”. 5. Count the number of Negative score by creating the Calculated Field “Total Negative Score”. 6.Count the number of Positive score by creating the Calculated Field “Total Positive Score”. 7. Count the number of Neutral score by creating the Calculated Field “Total Neutral Score”. 8. Count the total number of records by create the Calculated Field “Total Score”. 8. Count the size/percentage of the negative score by creating Calculated Field “Percentage of Negative Sizing”. 9. Count the size/percentage of the Positive score by creating Calculated Field“Percentage of Positive Sizing”. 10. Count the size/percentage of the Neutral score by creating Calculated Field Create Calculated Field “Percentage of Neutral Sizing”. 11. Change the “Number Format” to Percentage for “Percentage of Neutral Sizing”, “Percentage of Positive Sizing” and \" Percentage of Negative Sizing“. 12. Create Calculated Field”Gantt Positive Percent“. 13. Create Calculated Field”Gantt Neutral Percent“. 14. Create Calculated Field”Gantt Negative Start“. 15. Create Calculated Field”Gantt Negative Percent“. 16. Convert the response from 5 scale to 3 scale value (Agree/Strongly Agree, Disagree/Strongly Disagree) by duplicating”Answer_Cleaned\" and edit the formula. Save the edited formula as Answer_Grp.  17. Create Calculated Field “Negative Score_Gantt”  18. Create Calculated Field “Total_Negative_Score_Gantt”  19. Create Calculated Field “Gantt Start”  20. Create Calculated Field “Gantt Percent”  21. Age is currently a range of value. Need to bin the value into 3 different bin. Go to Age and create Group. 22. Create the following Age Group.  23. To provide reader with the option of breaking down the data into different categories, Create Parameter “Breakdown”.  24. Create Calculated Field “Breakdown By”.  25. Rename “Table Name” to “Countries” \r\nCreate a sheet to be included as part of Tooltip. This sheet will be used to detailed out the percentage for each of the rating. \r\nCreate a new sheet “DetailedStat”. Drag “Answer_Grp” to Rows, “Measure Names” to Columns, “Gantt Percent” and “Percentage of Total Sizing” to Measure Values. \r\nDrag the “Breakdown By” to the Columns to facilitate the use of Breakdown parameter.\r\nCreate a sheet to be included as part of Tooltip. This sheet will be used as Legend for the Likert Scale. \r\nDrag “Answer_Cleaned” to Columns. “Answer_Cleaned” to Color and “CNTD(RecordNumber)” to Size. \r\nSave the sheet as Legend. \r\nCreate a sheet to show the result of the survey in Likert Scale. This sheet will be used as part of the Tooltip. \r\nGo to a new sheet. Drag “Gantt Percent” to Columns. “Countries” to Rows. “Answer_Cleaned” to Color and “Percentage of Total Sizing” to Size and Label. Change the “Compute Using” for “Gantt Percent” and “Percentage of Total Sizing” to “Answer_Cleaned”. \r\nRight click on the x-axis and select “Add Reference Line” to add Reference Line. \r\nAt the popup, change the “Value” to 0 and Constant. Label to None, Tooltip to None and Line to —–  4. Save the sheet as “Gantt_Tooltip”.\r\nCreate a sheet that will calculate the 95% Confidence Interval of the survey result. This sheet would be added into the tooltip. \r\nCreate a new calculated field “Prop Positive”. This is to count the probability of all Agree/Strongly Agree score.\r\nCreate a new calculated field “Prop Negative”. This is to count the probability of all DisAgree/Strongly DisAgree score.\r\nCreate a new calculated field “Prop Neutral”. This is to count the probability of Neutral score.\r\nCreate a new calculated field “Prop_SE_Positive” \r\nCreate a new calculated field “Prop_ SE_Negative” \r\nCreate a new calculated field “Prop_SE_Neutral” \r\nCreate a new calculated field \"Prop_Upper_Limit_95%_Positive\", to calculate the upper limit of the Agree/Strongly Agree 95% Confidence Interval. \r\nCreate a new calculated field \"Prop_Upper_Limit_95%_Negative\", to calculate the upper limit of the DisAgree/Strongly DisAgree 95% Confidence Interval. \r\nCreate a new calculated field \"Prop_Upper_Limit_95%_Neutral\", to calculate the upper limit of the Neutral 95% Confidence Interval \r\nCreate a new calculated field \"Prop_Lower_Limit_95%_Neutral\" \r\nCreate a new calculated field \"Prop_Lower_Limit_95%_Positive\" \r\nCreate a new calculated field \"Prop_Lower_Limit_95%_Negative\" \r\nCreate a new calculated field “Z_95%” to store the value of the Z-score \r\nDrag “Prop_Positive” to Columns and Countries to “Rows”. Change it to Circle under the Mark card.  15. Drag Measure Values to centre of the screen \r\nExclude all the values and only retain \"Prop_Lower_Limit_95%_Positive\" and \"Prop_Upper_Limit_95%_Positive\"\r\nOn the x-axis, click “Synchronize Axis” \r\nUnder the “Measure Values” Mark card, Change it to Line \r\nDrag the “Measure Name” to Path. \r\nChange the “Compute Using” for \"Prop_Lower_Limit_95%_Positive“,”Prop_Upper_Limit_95%_Positive\" and “Prop Positive” to Cells. \r\nRight click on the Value axis and uncheck the Show Header. \r\nRight click on Prop Positive axis and choose format. Change the scale to Percentage. \r\nGo to Measure Values Mark card, change the color. \r\nGo to Prop Positive Mark card and change the size. \r\nSwitch the Prop_Positive and Measure Values under Column. \r\nSave the sheet as “Conf_Positive”. \r\nRepeat the process in creating Conf_Positive for “Conf_Negative” and “Conf_Neutral”. This time choosing Prop_Lower_Limit_95%_Negative and Prop_Upper_Limit_95%_Negative for “Conf_Negative” and Prop_Lower_Limit_95%_Neutral and Prop_Upper_Limit_95%_Neutral for “Conf_Neutral”\r\nCreate Visualisation in sheets 1. Create a new sheets and name it “Main”. Drag “Gantt Negative Percent” to Columns, “Table Name” to Rows, “Answer_Grp to Color and”Percentage of Negative Sizing\" to Size.  2. Change the Compute Using for “Gantt Negative Percent” and “Percentage of Negative Sizing” to “Answer_Grp”. 3. Drag “Gantt Positive Percent” to Columns,“Answer_Grp” to Color and “Percentage of Positive Sizing” to Size.  4. Change the Compute Using for “Gantt Positive Percent” and “Percentage of Positive Sizing” to “Answer_Grp”. 5. Drag “Gantt Neutral Percent” to Columns,“Answer_Grp” to Color and “Percentage of Neutral Sizing” to Size.  6. Change the Compute Using for “Gantt Neutral Percent” and “Percentage of Neutral Sizing” to “Answer_Grp”.\r\nChange the title of the x-axis. \r\nChange the scale of x-axis to Percentage and change the range. \r\nAdd “Breakdown By” to Rows of “Main”. Under Parameter, Click on “Show Parameter” for “Breakdown”. \r\nAdd “Question” to Filter and click OK. \r\nAllow the “Question” filter to apply to other sheets (“Grantt_Tooltip”,“DetailedStat”,“Prop_Positive”, “Prop_Negative” and “Prop_Neutral”) by right clicking on the Question Filter. \r\nGo to Customise and uncheck “Show All Value”. This will remove the (All) value \r\nOn the “Gantt Negative Percent” card, click on tooltip and edit the tooltip. \r\nSheets can be added to the tooltip by clicking on the “Insert” \r\nChange to tooltip with the code as displayed. \r\nRepeat the process for “Gantt Positive Percent” card. Only different is to insert “Conf_Positive” sheet to the 95% Confidence Interval portion. \r\nRepeat the process for “Gantt Neutral Percent” card. Only different is to insert “Conf_Neutral” sheet to the 95% Confidence Interval portion. \r\nChange the title for Main by right clicking on the title and choose Edit Title. \r\nChange the title as follows: \r\nCreate Dashboard 1. Drag “Main” into Dashboard and name it “FinalDisplay”. \r\nFinal Data Visualisation Output\r\n\r\nObservation 1\r\nBased on the data visualisation for the question: “If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, i would definitely get it.”, Singapore have the lowest Percentage of Agree/Strongly Agree (34.5%). However, if only look at Strongly Agree, Japan has the lowest percentage (18.1%). There is a need to determine how to interpret the data for agree and strongly agree (similarly, for disagree and strongly disagree) as it will affect the overall interpretation of the data. \r\nObservation 2\r\nFor all the vaccine-related questions (except “I am worried about getting Covid19” and “I am worried about the potential side effects of a Covid19 vaccine”), the elderly (> 55 years old) are more receptive. Across the 13 countries listed, except South-Korea, participants above 55 years old have the highest percentage of Agree/Strongly Agree, Lowest Percentage of Disagree/Strongly Disagree and Lowest Percentage of Neutral. Figure shows result for one of the questions.\r\n\r\nObservation 3\r\nFor all the vaccine-related questions (except “I am worried about getting Covid19” and “I am worried about the potential side effects of a Covid19 vaccine”), participants from United-Kingdom and Denmark constantly had the highest percentage of Agree/Strongly Agree and lowest percentage of Disagree/Strongly Disagree across the different questions related to Covid-19 vaccine. The two countries also had the narrowest interval between the upper and lower limit, indicating that the result are precised. Figure shows result for one of the questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Therefore, the value of the line graph is not immediately obvious.\r\nTo include Y axis and gridline to guide the eyes.\r\n2.\r\nIt is not intuitive to know which value on the X-axis represent the age and which is the labour force participating rate.\r\nTo include clear labels for the axis.\r\n3.\r\nThe visualisation shows the median age for 2009 is 41 years and the median age for 2019 is 44 years. However, the line graph do not have any statistical information to derive the median age but reference lines were drawn to intercept with the line graph. Inferring that the line graph could generate the median age.\r\nTo remove median data from the visualisation.\r\n4.\r\nThe objective of the visualisation is to show there are more older residents in the labour force since 2009. The visualisation only show data for 2009 and 2019 and not the data between 2009 to 2019. The increasing trend is not apparent to the readers.\r\nTo include data points for the years between 2009 and 2019.\r\n5.\r\nClear graph title to tell readers the context.\r\nTo retain the use of title.\r\n6.\r\nX-axis title could be better positioned and named to provide context.\r\nTo re-position the X-axis title.\r\n7.\r\nSource where the information were from were highlighted to give assurance to reader on the accuracy of the data.\r\nTo retain the source information on the visualisation.\r\nAesthetics\r\nS/N\r\nCRITIQUES\r\nSUGGESTIONS\r\n1.\r\nGood use of colour to differentiate 2009 and 2019 values.\r\nTo maintain the use of colour to differentiate values.\r\n2.\r\nGood font and good font size to detailed out the information.\r\nTo maintain the use of good font and good font size.\r\n3.\r\nUnits are not indicated at the X-axis tick values.

Select T7_T from the Connection Pane and Single Table in the Input Pane. 2. Add a “Clean Step”\r\n2.\r\nCommence Data Preparation\r\n1. Remove first 6 rows of the data which are all title information. 2. Remove columns with NULL values.  3. Rename first column to Age and the rest of columns to the year starting from 2009 to 2019. 4. Select column 2009 to 2019, pivot the columns to rows. 5. Rename Pivot 1 Name to Year and Pivot 1 Value to Population.\r\n3.\r\nSave the data\r\nSave the output as Output.hyper.\r\n4.\r\nImport the Output.hyper to Tableau\r\n1. Import data into Tableau.  2.

Drag Year to Columns. 3. Drag Population to Rows. 4. Change the measures for Population to SUM. 5. Change the Percentage of to Cell.\r\n6.\r\nGrouping of Age Group\r\n1. Select 15-19 and 20-24, right click and Grouped them. 2. Select 25-29, 30-34, 35,39,40-44, 45-49 and 50-54 and Grouped them. 3. Select 55-59,60-64, 65-69 and 70 & Over and Grouped them. 4. Rename each of the Age Category and Title. 5. Show the Hide Marker. 6. Rename the Title and axis labels and provide Source information under Caption. 7. Rename the sheet to \"Labour(%)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\nCreate Visualisation for Population (In Thousands)\r\n1. Duplicate Sheet 1.  2.

Drag Labour(%) to the left of the dashboard and Labour(In Thousands) to the right. 3. Rename the Dashboard Title. 4. Export the dashboard as image.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Data Visualisation Output\r\n\r\nObservation 1\r\nAlthough the labour force participation rate shows the share of resident labour force aged 25-54 declined from 75% to 67%, the absolute number of people in the age band actually increases (from 1496 thousands in 2009 to 1570 thousands in 2019)\r\nObservation 2\r\nOver the last 10 years, both the 25-54 and 15-24 age bands showed a downward trend for the participation rate while the 55 years and above showed a upward trend. Might be due to ageing population and low birth rate.\r\nObservation 3\r\nTotal number of people in the working population increases over the years (from 1986 thousands in 2009 to 2328 thousands in 2019).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
