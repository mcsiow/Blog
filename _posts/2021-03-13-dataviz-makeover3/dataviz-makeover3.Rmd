# Data Visualisation Critique

The original visualisation (as follows) reveal the spatio-temporal patterns of armed conflict in selected South-East Asia countries between 2015 to 2020. 
![](images/question.jpg) <br><br> 

## Clarity

| **S/N**	| **CRITIQUES**                                                                                                            	| **SUGGESTIONS**                                              	|
|-----	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|----------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1.   	| Under the "Armed Conflict Event by Type" chart, the Y-axis for each of the event type did not start from 0 and had different interval values. This will mislead the reader in thinking that the line chart are of the same value scale. | To standardise the Y-axis interval.         	|
| 2.   	| Under the "Armed Conflict Event by Type" chart, the title of the Y-axis ("Count of Sheet1") is not intuitive. Unsure what the Y-value actually meant. | To change the title of the Y-axis.           	|
| 3.   	| The title for the left chart stated that the map shows information on Myanmar. However, the title for the right chart did not confirm that the information showed in the right charts are for Myanmar. | To label the title clearly.           	|

## Aesthetics

| **S/N**	| **CRITIQUES**                                                                                                            	| **SUGGESTIONS**                                              	|
|-----	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|----------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1.   	| The colored circles on the map had covered the labeling for "Myanmar". Will be good to label the country so that readers know that is the map for Myanmar.                           	| To label the countries clearly.   	|
| 2.   	| Under the "Armed Conflict Event by Type" chart, the value after 2019 could not be seen clearly. | To show the value of the X-axis clearly.  |   
| 3.    | The labeling on the right chart should use darker color tone to make it more prominent. | To use darker color tone for label.      |


## Interactivity

| **S/N**	| **CRITIQUES**                                                                                                            	| **SUGGESTIONS**                                              	|
|-----	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|----------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1.   	| Currently, readers are only able to select and focus on the country of his choice. No further information are presented. | To have tooltips to provide more information to the readers, like number of conflicts etc.   	|
| 2.   	| Readers are unable to select and focus on the events of his choice.  | To allow readers to select and focus on the event of his choice.     	


# Proposed Design

![Design Sketch](images/Design.jpg)






The Advantages or issues that the alternative design tries to overcome are:

- To include tooltips to detail out more information. <br><br>
- To provide overview of the type of events (Demonstrations, Non-violent Actions and Violent Events) instead of the detailed breakdown of the different type of events (Battles, Explosions/Remote Violence, Protests, Riots, Strategic Developments and Violence against civilian). This will allow readers to have a quick overview of the information. The detailed breakdown will be included in the tooltips. Those interested can see more details under the tooltips. <br><br>
- Use Choropleth Map to represent the number of events that each countries have. This will give readers a quick overview on the number of events that happened in South East Asia. Readers who want to know more details can read more information in the tooltip.<br><br>
- Beside country, to also allow readers to filter information by event type. This allow user to focus on the type of event he wanted. <br><br>
- Beside the number of events, to include information on the number of fatalities as well. <br><br>

## Changes from Original Design

- To have a total of three dashboards instead of one. The first dashboard give readers a quick overview of 
1) the number of fatalities from 2015 to 2020.
2) Pie chart on the map to detailed out the proportion of events/conflicts (Demonstrations, Non-violent Actions and Violent Events).
3) An overview of the number of events/conflicts that each countries have using Choropleth Map.

Readers who are interested in more details, able to navigate to the next dashboard for more information.

- The second dashboard provide readers with:
1) Detailed location of each of the event/conflict.
2) Chart to show the number of fatalities and conflicts between 2015 to 2020, breakdown by event type (Battles, Explosions/Remote Violence, Protests, Riots, Strategic Developments and Violence against civilian).
3) Allow readers to filter by country or by event, so as to focus on the relevant information.

Readers who are interested to see the breakdown by time, able to navigate to the third dashboard.

- The third dashboard allows the readers to filter the events and country by time.



## Observation 1

Philippines had the most number of conflicts between 2016 to 2020 and also had the most number of fatalities across South East Asia. However, it can be observed that the number of violent conflicts gradually decreases from 2016. 
<br><br>![](images/screenshot.78.jpg){width=100%} <br> 

## Observation 2

Most of the Battles, Explosion/Remote Violence, Strategic Developments and Violent against Civilians that happen in Myanmar, occurred in Rakhine and Shan state. 
<br><br>![](images/Presentation1.jpg){width=100%} <br> 

## Observation 3

Battles and Violence against Civilians resulted in most number of fatalities. 
<br><br>![](images/screenshot.86.jpg){width=100%} <br> 


## Observation 4

Indonesia had seen a sharp increase in number of Protests from 2017 to 2020. 198 events recorded in 2017 and 1050 events recorded in 2020.
<br><br>![](images/screenshot.87.jpg){width=100%} <br> 

## Observation 5

Kalimantan (Indonesia) is relatively peaceful, without much conflicts from 2015 to 2020. Most of the conflicts happened at the borders of Kalimantan.
