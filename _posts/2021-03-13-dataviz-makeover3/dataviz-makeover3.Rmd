# Data Visualisation Critique

The original visualisation (as follows) reveal the spatio-temporal patterns of armed conflict in selected South-East Asia countries between 2015 to 2020.

## Clarity

| **S/N**	| **CRITIQUES**                                                                                                            	| **SUGGESTIONS**                                              	|
|-----	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|----------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1.   	| Under the "Armed Conflict Event by Type" chart, the Y-axis for each of the event type did not start from 0 and had different interval values. This will mislead the reader in thinking that the line chart are of the same value scale. | To standardise the Y-axis interval.         	|
| 2.   	| Under the "Armed Conflict Event by Type" chart, the title of the Y-axis ("Count of Sheet1") is not intuitive. Unsure what the Y-value actually meant. | To change the title of the Y-axis.           	|
| 3.   	| The title for the left chart stated that the map shows information on Myanmar. However, the title for the right chart did not confirm that the information showed in the right charts are for Myanmar. | To label the title clearly.           	|
| 4.    | The colored circles on the map show the location of individual events. As multiple events could happened on the same location, the overlapping information might not be picked up by the readers. Will be good to show summation of number of events that occur on a particular location. This will allow readers to know the frequency in which a particular events had occurred. | To provide summation of number of events that occurs on a particular location.|

## Aesthetics

|-----	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|----------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1.   	| The colored circles on the map had covered the labeling for "Myanmar". Will be good to label the country so that readers know that is the map for Myanmar.                           	| To label the countries clearly.   	|
| 2.   	| Under the "Armed Conflict Event by Type" chart, the value after 2019 could not be seen clearly. | To show the value of the X-axis clearly.  |   
| 3.    | The labeling on the "Armed Conflict Event by Type" chart should use darker color tone to make it more prominent. | To use darker color tone for label.      |
| 4.    | No X-axis gridline for the "Armed Conflict Event by Type" chart. Hard to interpret the value for the x-axis (Year).       | To include gridline for X-axis.    |


## Interactivity

| 1.   	| Currently, readers are only able to filter by country. Should also allow readers to filter by event types so that he can focus on the information that he wanted.  |To allow readers to select and focus on the event of his choice as well. 	|
| 2.    | The tooltip show the Event ID Cnty, Longitude, Latitude and Event Type.  The information presented is not useful to readers.Could provide more statistical information to the readers. | To provide more statistical information in the tooltips. | 


# Proposed Design

![Design Sketch](images/Design.jpg)






The Advantages or issues that the alternative design tries to overcome are:

- Tooltip to include more statistical information of the country.<br><br>
- To provide overview of the type of events (Demonstrations (includes Protests and Riots), Non-violent Actions (includes Strategic Developments) and Violent Events (includes Battles, Explosions/Remote Violence and Violence against Civilians)) instead of the detailed breakdown of the different type of events (Battles, Explosions/Remote Violence, Protests, Riots, Strategic Developments and Violence against civilian). This will allow readers to have a quick overview of the information. The detailed breakdown will be included in the tooltips. Those interested can see more details under the tooltips. <br><br>
- Use Choropleth Map to represent the number of events that each countries have. This will give readers a quick overview on the number of events that happened in South East Asia. Readers who want to know more details can read more information in the tooltip.<br><br>
- Beside country, to also allow readers to filter information by event type. This allow user to focus on the type of event he wanted. <br><br>
- Beside the number of events, to include information on the number of fatalities as well. <br><br>

# Final Data Visualisation Output

![First Dashboard](images/screenshot.143.jpg){width=100%}<br><br>![Second Dashboard](images/screenshot.144.jpg){width=100%} <br><br>  

## Changes from Original Design

- To have a total of two dashboards instead of one. The first dashboard give readers a quick overview of 
1) the number of fatalities from 2015 to 2020.
2) Pie chart on the map to detailed out the proportion of events/conflicts (Demonstrations, Non-violent Actions and Violent Events).
3) An overview of the number of events/conflicts that each countries have using Choropleth Map.
4) Tooltips to show breakdown of the total of event and percentage of total.

Readers who are interested in more details, able to navigate to the next dashboard for more information.

- The second dashboard provide readers with:
1) Detailed location of each of the event/conflict.
2) Chart to show the number of fatalities and conflicts, breakdown by event type (Battles, Explosions/Remote Violence, Protests, Riots, Strategic Developments and Violence against civilian).
3) Allow readers to filter by country or by event, so as to focus on the relevant information.
4) Tooltips to show breakdown of the total of event and percentage of total.
5) Allow readers to change the view of the chart (by Country or by Event)



## Observation 1

Based on the Choropleth Map, it shows that Philippines had the most number of conflicts between 2015 to 2020. Focusing on Philippines, it can be observed that the number of fatalities due to violent conflicts gradually decreases from 2016.

## Observation 2

Based on the pie chart on the map, it can be observed that the capital of the countries experienced the most number of protests.
<br><br>![](images/Combined.jpg){width=100%} <br> 


## Observation 3

Most of the Battles in Myanmar, occurred in Rakhine and Shan state. In Thailand, most of the battles happened at the southern states (Narathiwat, Yala and Pattani). In Philippines, battles happened across the country. 
<br><br>![](images/screenshot.156.jpg){width=100%} <br> 

## Observation 4

Battles and Violence against Civilians resulted in most number of fatalities. 
<br><br>![](images/screenshot.157.jpg){width=100%} <br> 


## Observation 5

Kalimantan (Indonesia) is relatively peaceful, without much conflicts from 2015 to 2020. Most of the conflicts happened at the borders of Kalimantan.It can also be observed that there is a spikes in the number of Protests in Indonesia and Thailand in 2020.
