# Data Visualisation Critique

The original visualisation (as follows) shows the willingness of the public on Covid-19 vaccination.

## Clarity

| **S/N**	| **CRITIQUES**                                                                                                            	| **SUGGESTIONS**                                              	|
|-----	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|----------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1.   	| Unable to determine the total number of people that responded to the survey. The result might not be representative if only a small number of people were interviewed.                                                                                                                                                                                                               	| To include the number of people interviewed from each country.         	|
| 2.   	| The left chart was sorted based on country while the right chart was sorted based on percentage of “strongly agreed”. Is hard for reader to match the result for the two charts. Moreover, the information presented in the right chart could be found in the left as well. Is redundant to show the information again.                                                                                                                                                                                                   	| Do not repeat information presented.                       	|
| 3.   	| The chart was derived from the survey question “If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it:”. This question does not imply that the individuals are pro-vaccine. There are other questions that could be interpreted as pro-vaccine as well. E.g “If I do not get a COVID19 vaccine when it is available, I will regret it”  	| To change the title of the graph            	|
| 4.   	| The "Legend" was titled as "Vac1". Unclear what "Vac1" means.                                                                 	| To be clear on the information presented.	|
| 5.   	| Is hard to determine the value for each of the rating (color bar).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    	| To label the value for each color bar.                           	| 




## Aesthetics

| **S/N**	| **CRITIQUES**                                                                                                            	| **SUGGESTIONS**                                              	|
|-----	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|----------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1.   	| All axes are clearly labeled.                             	| To continue to label all axes.   	|
| 2.   	| Good font and good font size to detailed out the information.                                                        	| To maintain the use of good font and good font size.     	|
| 3.   	| The choice of color for the bar is overwhelming and a bit distracting. 	| To change the color scheme.                     	|





# Proposed Design

![Design Sketch](images/Sketch.jpg)


- Change the scale of the result from 5 (Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree and Strongly Disagree) to 3 (Agree/Strongly Agree, Neutral and Disagree/Strongly Disagree) to facilitate reading. Since Strongly Agree and Agree as well as Strongly Disagree and Disagree do mean the same things here. <br><br>
- Break the Disagree, Agree and Neutral into 3 charts so that readers can see the distribution clearly. <br><br>
- Show the question so that readers better understand the context to the response. <br><br>
- Allow breakdown by Gender, Age etc so that readers can better appreciate the details. <br><br>
- To have tooltip to detail out more information for readers who are interested to find out more details. <br><br>

# Final Data Visualisation Output

![](images/screenshot.69.jpg){width=100%}

## Observation 1

Based on the data visualisation for the question: "If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, i would definitely get it.", Singapore have the lowest Percentage of Agree/Strongly Agree (34.5%). However, if only look at Strongly Agree, Japan has the lowest percentage (18.1%). There is a need to determine how to interpret the data for agree and strongly agree (similarly, for disagree and strongly disagree) as it will affect the overall interpretation of the data.

<br><br>![](images/screenshot.66.jpg){width=100%} <br><br>  



## Observation 2

For all the vaccine-related questions (except "I am worried about getting Covid19" and "I am worried about the potential side effects of a Covid19 vaccine"), the elderly (> 55 years old) are more receptive. Across all countries, participants above 55 years old have the highest percentage of Agree/Strongly Agree, Lowest Percentage of Disagree/Strongly Disagree and Lowest Percentage of Neutral. Figure show result for one of the question.<br><br>

## Observation 3

For all the vaccine-related questions (except "I am worried about getting Covid19" and "I am worried about the potential side effects of a Covid19 vaccine"), participants from United-Kingdom and Denmark constantly had the highest percentage of Agree/Strongly Agree and lowest percentage of Disagree/Strongly Disagree across the different questions related to Covid-19 vaccine. <br><br>
