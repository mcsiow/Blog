# Data Visualisation Critique

The original visualisation (as follows) shows the willingness of the public on Covid-19 vaccination.

| 2.   	| The chart was derived from the survey question “If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it:”. This question does not imply that the individuals are pro-vaccine. There are other similar questions (e.g: "If I do not get a COVID19 vaccine when it is available, I will regret it") but the results were not used. The result might not be representative and will be misleading to the reader.  	| To change the title of the graph or include the question to provide clarity.           	|
| 3.   	| The "Legend" was titled as "Vac1". Unclear what "Vac1" means. Number 2 to 4 are not labelled to tell reader what it represent.                                                                	| To be clear on the information presented.	|

# Proposed Design

![Design Sketch](images/Sketch.jpg)


The Advantages or issues that the alternative design tries to overcome are:

- Change the scale of the result from 5 (Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree and Strongly Disagree) to 3 (Agree/Strongly Agree, Neutral and Disagree/Strongly Disagree). Presenting the results in a simplified categories helps in making the chart easier to read. Since Strongly Agree and Agree as well as Strongly Disagree and Disagree, in this instance, do indicate inclination towards willingness or unwillingness.<br><br>
- Break the Disagree, Agree and Neutral into 3 charts so that readers can see the distribution clearly. <br><br>
- Show the questions so that readers better understand the context to the response. Include details such as when the surveys were taken, number of people involved so as to provide more clarity to readers.<br><br>
- Allow breakdown by Gender, Age etc so that readers can better appreciate the details. <br><br>
- To have tooltip to detail out more information for readers who are interested to find out more. <br><br>
- To include Confidence Interval to indicate the uncertainty of the outcome.



# Data Visualisation Steps

- <b> Preparing the Dataset<b><br><br> 1. Comparing the fields of the dataset, one can realises that Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden do not have the field "employment_status". Instead, the employment status was capture by various fields (employment_status_1, employment_status_2 etc.)<br><br> ![](images/screenshot.131.jpg){width=100%} <br><br> 2. To align to the rest of the dataset, need to create the field "employment_status" and change the header to reflect the employment status ("Fulltime Employment","Not Working" etc)<br><br> ![](images/screenshot.132.jpg){width=100%} <br><br> 3. Use the formula to update the value for "employment_status".<br><br> ![](images/screenshot.133.jpg){width=100%} <br><br> 4. Save the file and repeat it for the rest of the countries (Norway, Denmark and Sweden). 5. For Sweden, there is a need to rename "record" to "RecordNo", to align to rest of the dataset. <br><br> ![](images/screenshot.134.jpg) <br><br>

- <b>Import data into Tableau<b> <br><br> 1. Select "Text File" from Connect Panel.<br><br>![](images/screenshot.2.jpg){width=100%} <br><br> 2. Select australia.csv. <br><br>![](images/screenshot.103.jpg) <br><br>  3. Remove australia.csv from the panel. <br><br> ![](images/screenshot.3.jpg){width=100%} <br><br>  4. Click on "New Union" under the File Panel. <br><br> ![](images/screenshot.104.jpg) <br><br> 5. Import all the countries into the "New Union" panel and click OK. <br><br> ![](images/screenshot.5.jpg) <br><br>

- <b>Commence Data Preparation<b><br><br> 1. Hide all the parameters and retain only the following a) RecordNo b) endtime c) household_children d) household_size e) gender f) age g) employment_status h) vac-1 i) vac2_1 j) vac2_2 k) vac2_3 l) vac2_6 and m) vac3. n) Table Name <br><br> ![](images/screenshot.6.jpg){width=100%} <br><br> 2. Convert the Connection to "Extract" <br><br> ![](images/screenshot.7.jpg) <br><br>  3. As we are only interested in Jan 2021 data, click on "Edit" under FILTER to add a filter. <br><br> 4. Add a filter for "endtime" and set it to Jan 2021. <br><br> ![](images/screenshot.9.jpg) <br><br>   5. Edit the range of date to Jan 2021, to use only Jan 2021 data.<br><br>![](images/screenshot.8.jpg) <br><br> 6. Select (vac1, vac2_1, vac2_2, vac2_3, vac2_6 and vac3) and pivot the data, for ease of processing subsequently. <br><br>![](images/screenshot.10.jpg){width=100%} <br><br>   7. Rename the "Pivot Field Names" to "Question" and "Pivot Field Values" to "Answer" <br><br> ![](images/screenshot.11.jpg) <br><br>  8. Change the aliases for Question to reflect the actual questions. <br><br> ![](images/screenshot.105.jpg) <br><br><br><br> ![](images/screenshot.13.jpg) <br><br>  9. As the "Answer" value consist of a mix of character and numeric data, need to remove all the characters information. Click on "Custom Split" at "Answer" <br><br> ![](images/screenshot.14.jpg) <br><br> 10. Add in the separator "–" to "Answer"<br><br> ![](images/screenshot.15.jpg) <br><br> 11. Add in separator "-" to Answer-Split1 <br><br> 12. Rename Answer-Split2 to "Answer_Cleaned" and change data type to "Number(Whole)" <br><br> ![](images/screenshot.20.jpg) <br><br> 13. Change the data type for household_size to String. <br><br> ![](images/screenshot.120.jpg) <br><br> 14. Change the aliases of "Table Name" to remove the .csv portion. <br><br> ![](images/screenshot.18.jpg) <br><br>

# Final Data Visualisation Output

![](images/screenshot.69.jpg){width=100%}<br><br>![](images/screenshot.125.jpg){width=100%} <br><br>  

## Observation 1

Based on the data visualisation for the question: "If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, i would definitely get it.", Singapore have the lowest Percentage of Agree/Strongly Agree (34.5%). However, if only look at Strongly Agree, Japan has the lowest percentage (18.1%). There is a need to determine how to interpret the data for agree and strongly agree (similarly, for disagree and strongly disagree) as it will affect the overall interpretation of the data.
<br><br>![](images/screenshot.126.jpg){width=100%} <br> 
<br><br>![](images/screenshot.127.jpg){width=100%} <br><br>  



## Observation 2

For all the vaccine-related questions (except "I am worried about getting Covid19" and "I am worried about the potential side effects of a Covid19 vaccine"), the elderly (> 55 years old) are more receptive. Across the 14 countries listed, except South-Korea, participants above 55 years old have the highest percentage of Agree/Strongly Agree, Lowest Percentage of Disagree/Strongly Disagree and Lowest Percentage of Neutral. Figure shows result for one of the questions.<br><br>

![](images/screenshot.128.jpg){width=100%} <br><br>  


## Observation 3

For all the vaccine-related questions (except "I am worried about getting Covid19" and "I am worried about the potential side effects of a Covid19 vaccine"), participants from United-Kingdom and Denmark constantly had the highest percentage of Agree/Strongly Agree and lowest percentage of Disagree/Strongly Disagree across the different questions related to Covid-19 vaccine. The two countries also had the narrowest interval between the upper and lower limit, indicating that the result are precised. Figure shows result for one of the questions.<br><br>
